## Intro and Script

#### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal

- when you give your computer the instruction in very details, like when you wanna build a house you dont just say I want a bed room here, no you have to be more specific like the demintion of the room and the thickness of the wall

## Expression and Operations 

### Expressions

- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions:

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALU

### Operators

- They allow programmers create a single value from one or more values, there are several types of operators like 

- logical operators 

``` 
buy = (3 > 5) && (2 < 4); 
```

- string operators

``` 
reeting = 'hello' + 'class' 
```

### Functions 

-  let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

#### declaring a function 

- it have its own data type
- you can call it whenever you want
- the following structure is your way to declaring a function


``` 
function-keyword functio-name { code-block } 
```

- see this example to get a better veiw 

``` 
if (hourNow > 18) { 
    greeting= 'Good evening!'; 
}  
```
