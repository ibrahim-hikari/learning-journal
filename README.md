# My name is Ibrahim Ajarmeh 
## this the change that I made on this file good luck everyone

- [Welcome](welcome)
- [Who am I](who-am-i)
- [bye-bye](bye-bye)

I am a freshly graduated _mechanical engineer_ specialized in _HVAC_ systems, **TOP** of my class if you ask me

I believe that I have a grouth mindset depending on: 
- loving the hard work,
- exciting to face new challenges,
- getting up as fast as I can after falling

Here come some reminders that I use almost all the time 
1. **Big Dream ... Long Story** (made it myself)
2. **Go Ahead And Be Shine** 
3. **No Pain No Gain**
